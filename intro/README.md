Mystery Word

The Computer picks a mystery word from a small library of random words (10-15). As an example, imagine the mystery word is "antelope".
The Player is tasked with guessing the mystery word; to do this, they'll guess one letter at a time. To begin with, they are shown how many letters are in the word via a string of underscores, e.g. "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _"
Whenever one of their letters is found in the word, it will be revealed to them. For example, if they guessed the letter "e", their progress would update to "_ _ _ e _ _ _ e"
Every time the Player guesses a letter that is not in the word, they receive a strike; a strike count is shown on the page.
If the visitor gets 6 strikes before completing the word, they lose. 
Bonus: 
Make it possible to guess the word before all letters have been filled in.
