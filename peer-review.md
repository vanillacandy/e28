*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
No. I didn't see any errors. 
I tested to add favorite to favorite list, and it add to the cart. 
The same expected result when I click on shopping list, it will add in cart. 
I tested to delete item from cart, and items are deleted. 
### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
At the beginning I did get confused with the differences of recipe list and shopping list. I didn't know the "heard" next to the recipe title means that I can click to add to recipe list. However, after few clicks, it made sense and it looks like a pretty design. 

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
Most are self-evident, at front page I would suggest that it might be helpful to add more comments for first commer. 

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
I learned from the design layout. It's colorful, definitely good for customer to use. 

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
The code has implemented the best practices discussed in course material without redundancy. 

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
Overall, it's a good website, only comment I can add on is to add more recipes so it could be used in real wordl!
